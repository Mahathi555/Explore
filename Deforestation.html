<h1>Greetings From Mahathi<h1>
<h2>Welcome To One And All,Now I Want To discuss About Deforestation</h2>
<p>
Deforestation is the cutting down of trees in the forest in a large number.<br>
Deforestation has always been a threat to our environment.<br> 
But still many humans are continuing this ill practice.<br>
Moreover, Deforestation is causing ecological imbalance.<br> 
Yet, some selfish people have to fill their pockets.<br>
Therefore they do not even think about it once.<br> 
So, the government is trying countermeasures to avert the harm to the environment.
