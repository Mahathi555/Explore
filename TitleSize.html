<h1>DEFORESTATION</h1>
<p>
Deforestation is the cutting down of trees in the forest in a large
 number. Deforestation has always been a threat to our environment.
 But still many humans are continuing this ill practice. 
Moreover, Deforestation is causing ecological imbalance.
 Yet, some selfish people have to fill their pockets. 
Therefore they do not even think about it once.
 So, the government is trying countermeasures to avert the
 harm to the environment.
